# Daily Tasks

Daily Tasks is a webapplication in which users can schedule new daily tasks to their digital agenda. After adding a task at the current day, it will be repeated for each following day. When a task is clicked on, it is denoted as 'done' by the check-symbol. Tasks are added by using the add-button at the upper right corner. It includes multiple functionalities which are a good learning practice and could be used in a lot of other projects. After this project I learned to work with blueprints and to use the current time/date to create the navigation buttons at the top. The navigation bar can be clicked to scroll to one of the previous/following days. CSS is used to adjust for diverse screensizes. A MongoDB database is used to link the uncompleted tasks to the already completed ones. It is created in Flask and uses coding languages as HTML (Jinja2), CSS, and Python.
